# Kernel Philosophy

The Amplifier kernel (`amplifier-core`) follows a philosophy inspired by the Linux kernel: provide mechanisms, not policy.

## Core Tenets

### 1. Mechanism, Not Policy

The kernel exposes **capabilities** and **stable contracts**. Decisions about behavior belong outside the kernel.

| Kernel Does (Mechanism) | Kernel Doesn't (Policy) |
|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Load modules | Choose which modules |
| Emit events | Decide what to log |
| Validate contracts | Format output |
| Provide hooks | Select providers |
| Manage sessions | Schedule execution |

**Litmus test**: If two teams could want different behavior, it's policy → keep it out of kernel.

### 2. Small, Stable, and Boring

The kernel is intentionally minimal (~2,600 lines) and changes rarely.

- **Small**: Can be audited in an afternoon
- **Stable**: Backward compatibility is sacred
- **Boring**: No clever tricks, no surprises

### 3. Don't Break Modules

Backward compatibility in kernel interfaces is sacred.

- Additive evolution only
- Clear deprecation with migration paths
- Long sunset periods for changes

### 4. Extensibility Through Composition

New behavior comes from plugging in different modules, not from toggleing flags.

```python
# Not this (configuration explosion)
session = Session(
    use_streaming=True,
    enable_approval=True,
    log_level="debug",
    ...
)

# This (composition)
mount_plan = {
    "orchestrator": "loop-streaming",
    "hooks": ["hooks-approval", "hooks-logging"]
}
```

## What Belongs in the Kernel

### Kernel Responsibilities (Mechanisms)

- **Stable contracts**: Protocol definitions for modules
- **Lifecycle coordination**: Load, unload, mount, unmount
- **Event emission**: Canonical events for observability
- **Capability enforcement**: Permission checks, approvals
- **Minimal context**: Session IDs, basic state

### Kernel Non-Goals (Policies)

- Orchestration strategies
- Provider/model selection
- Tool behavior or domain rules
- Output formatting
- Logging destinations
- Business defaults

## Invariants

These properties must **always** hold:

1. **Backward compatibility**: Existing modules work across kernel updates
2. **Non-interference**: Faulty modules can't crash the kernel
3. **Bounded side-effects**: Kernel doesn't make irreversible external changes
4. **Deterministic semantics**: Same inputs = same behavior
5. **Minimal dependencies**: No transitive dependency sprawl

## Evolution Rules

### 1. Additive First

Extend contracts without breaking them. Prefer optional capabilities.

```python
# Good: Optional new parameter
async def complete(self, request: ChatRequest, **kwargs) -> ChatResponse:
    thinking = kwargs.get("thinking", None)  # New, optional
    ...

# Bad: Required new parameter
async def complete(self, request: ChatRequest, thinking: ThinkingConfig) -> ChatResponse:
    ...  # Breaks existing providers
```

### 2. Two-Implementation Rule

Don't promote a concept into kernel until **≥2 independent modules** converge on the need.

```
Module A needs X  →  Prototype X in Module A
Module B needs X  →  Prototype X in Module B
A and B converge  →  Extract X to kernel
```

### 3. Spec Before Code

Kernel changes begin with a short spec:

- Purpose
- Alternatives considered
- Impact on invariants
- Test strategy
- Rollback plan

### 4. Complexity Budget

Each kernel change must justify its complexity. Additions should retire equivalent complexity elsewhere.

## Interface Guidance

### Small and Sharp

Prefer few, precise operations over broad, do-everything calls.

```python
# Good: Focused operations
coordinator.mount("providers", provider, name="anthropic")
coordinator.unmount("providers", "anthropic")

# Bad: Swiss army knife
coordinator.manage("providers", operation="mount", module=provider, name="anthropic", options={...})
```

### Stable Schemas

Version any data shapes crossing kernel boundaries.

```python
class ChatRequest(BaseModel):
    """Versioned request format."""
    schema_version: str = "1.0"
    messages: list[Message]
    # New fields are optional with defaults
    temperature: float = 1.0  # Added in 1.1
```

### Explicit Errors

Fail closed with actionable diagnostics. No silent fallbacks.

```python
# Good: Clear error
raise ModuleNotFoundError(
    f"Module '{module_id}' not found. "
    f"Available modules: {available}. "
    f"Check your mount plan configuration."
)

# Bad: Silent fallback
if module not found:
    use_default_module()  # Hidden behavior
```

## Security Posture

### Deny by Default

Kernel offers no ambient authority. Modules must request capabilities explicitly.

```python
# Module must explicitly request
coordinator.register_capability("file_system", implementation)

# And explicitly use
fs = coordinator.get_capability("file_system")
```

### Sandbox Boundaries

All calls across boundaries are validated, attributed, and observable.

```python
# Every tool call is observable
await coordinator.hooks.emit("tool:pre", {
    "tool_name": tool.name,
    "input": sanitized_input,
    "session_id": session_id
})
```

### Non-Interference

Module failures are isolated. The kernel stays up.

```python
try:
    result = await tool.execute(input)
except Exception as e:
    # Log error, don't crash kernel
    await coordinator.hooks.emit("tool:error", {"error": str(e)})
    return ToolResult(success=False, error=str(e))
```

## Red Flags

Watch for these anti-patterns:

| Anti-Pattern | Why It's Wrong |
|--------------|----------------|
| "Add a flag for this use case" | Flags accumulate; use modules |
| "Pass whole context for flexibility" | Violates minimal capability |
| "Break API now, adoption is small" | Sets bad precedent |
| "Add to kernel now, figure out policy later" | Policy will leak in |
| "It's only one more dependency" | Dependencies compound |

## North Star

- **Unshakeable center**: A kernel so small and stable it can be maintained by one person
- **Explosive edges**: A flourishing ecosystem of competing modules
- **Forever upgradeable**: Ship improvements weekly at edges, kernel updates are rare and boring
